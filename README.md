# prowl-target

Example repo for testing prowl-github-app

## Collaboration

Markdown requires a review, others will be auto-merged
Ony one reviewer from each config is required

## .prowl.yml

See the `examples/` dir for supported configs
Now supports pagination
And merge methods!
Updated to probot 7
Automerge now has to be specified explicitly
Should get a status update instead of a merge! (and this should block as a required check)
Merge checks should now also return failure instead of lurking
